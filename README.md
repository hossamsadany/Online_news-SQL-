Postgresql project using sql query to explore a database table called "articles"
# project overview
Following the changes in working habits during the COVID pandemic, The local library has decided it is time to make the newspaper archives available online. They are not sure what the response will be so they are going to trial a new system on a small set of their data.

The library database has a table articles with a record of all articles published in the newspaper. However, the table will need some preparation before the library can use it in the new system. They would like to focus the initial trial on articles from 2014 and 2015 only, and for just one journalist whose ID in the database is 1754.

The final results should be sorted from earliest published date to the most recent published date.
